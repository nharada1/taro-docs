We are thrilled to announce the beta release of Taro AI -- autocomplete for arborists! We've been hard at work for the past few months to bring Taro AI to life, and we're stoked to share it with you. From here on out we'll be providing updates on our progress and roadmap. We'll be providing [release notes](/) on new features and improvements when we make major updates.

So why Taro? Tree inventory and mapping software is a critical tool for arborists, but it's often a manual process that requires users to spend an unreasonable amount of time on data entry. The software can be complex and inflexible, not always working for your particular workflow and needs. In many cases, arborists are left to use a combination of pen and paper, spreadsheets, and other manual processes to track their trees, often because this is actually faster than using the software available.

We believe that Taro AI can do better. Using computer vision and AI, we can make tree inventory and mapping software that is easy to use, flexible, and efficient all at once. Software that bends to your workflow, not the other way around. If you're interested in learning more, [sign up for our waitlist](https://forms.gle/HHnBvSLqbPKc19Mm7) today!
